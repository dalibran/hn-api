This is a Hacker News API clone built as a tutorial for learning GraphQL. I followed the Rails track on ![How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com). Through this tutorial I defined a GraphQL schema, connected various types, wrote mutations to create and edit data, and I built complex queries. In addition, several of the resolver functions are covered with unit tests.

<h3>Development</h3>

1. Clone the Repo onto your Local Machine

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:dalibran/personalv3.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory and Install Relevant Gems

3. Start the Rails server and navigate to /graphiql to play with the API
